The [ELMing H-mode](/pages/fusionprimer/hmode) is the most commonly-accessed high-performance regime on major tokamak experiments.  The bursts of energy and particle transport driven by ELM crashes provide sufficient venting of impurities to allow stationary operation without excessive radiative losses - as such, it is considered the baseline scenario for reactor operation.  However, on reactor-scale devices, ELMs drive pulsed heat loading unacceptable levels of erosion and damage to plasma-facing materials.

As a component of my doctoral research,
