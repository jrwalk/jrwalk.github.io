The [I-mode](/pages/fusionprimer/imode) presents a number of attractive properties for a tokamak reactor scenario, notably good performance with minimal impurity retention, and an apparent natural lack of large [ELMs](/pages/fusionprimer/hmode).

As part of my doctoral thesis, and coupled with my experimental work in characterizing the [I-mode pedestal](/pages/projects/imode-pedestal), I carried out a dedicated computational study of the stability of the I-mode pedestal against known ELM triggers, using the tools and techniques developed for my [previous study in ELMy H-mode](/pages/projects/elmy).

The I-mode pedestal is consistently computationally modeled to be strongly stable to both the peeling-ballooning MHD instability and kinetic-ballooning (KBM) turbulence associated with the ELM trigger, far from the stability boundary (cf. the ELITE result for [ELMy H-mode](/pages/projects/elmy)), even in the highest-performance cases, consistent with a lack of ELMs.

This stability is intuitive, in light of the pedestal dynamics in I-mode - due to the relaxed density profile in the pedestal, the total pressure gradient is reduced in I-mode compared to H-mode, as is the edge current density (largely due to self-generated "bootstrap current" that appears in tokamaks, driven largely by strong density gradients).  Thus, the I-mode pedestal is backed off from both the ballooning and the peeling MHD instability drives.

The I-mode pedestal width is also evidently not limited by KBM turbulence.  The pedestal width is consistently broader (thus more stable) than would be predicted for a given pressure by the KBM limit, and shows no systematic trend with (normalized) pedestal pressure, as would be expected for width-limiting KBM turbulence.
