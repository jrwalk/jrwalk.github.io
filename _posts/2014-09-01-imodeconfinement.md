The I-mode is a promising new operating regime for tokamak fusion reactor designs. As a component of my thesis research, I developed the first comprehensive study of the [pedestal structure in I-mode](/pages/projects/imode-pedestal), using a series of dedicated experiments on MITâ€™s Alcator C-Mod tokamak.  In conjunction with this, my thesis work included an examination of the impact of the pedestal on global energy confinement in I-mode - the understanding of which is essential for extrapolating the regime to reactor-scale tokamaks.

The I-mode' strong temperature pedestal supports very high core temperatures relative to comparable H-modes, such that at moderate densities the I-mode can attain competitive core pressure (thus fusion power density) despite the relaxed, [naturally-stable](/pages/projects/imode-stability) pedestal.
