<p>The basic computational tasks associated with magnetic-equilibrium reconstructions in tokamaks, namely</p>

* the handling of derived quantities, *e.g.,* calculated plasma current, safety factor profile
* flux mapping between real-space machine geometry and different plasma coordinate systems for experimental data

<p>are universal among tokamak fusion experiments.  Despite this, experiments typically utilize locally-developed solutions designed for the particulars of that experiment's data storage and usage.</p>

<p>These tasks are base-level for nearly any analysis workflow in a tokamak - but the ad-hoc development in existing toolkits inhibits the mobility of higher-level codes (which use data based on magnetic reconstructions) to other devices (as the code may require substantial rewrites or modification to address the particulars of the new data storage design).  Moreover, reconstruction codes are often developed with a quite static design, such that the code implementation is difficult to extend to new data formats (<i>e.g.,</i> to handle both the primary MDSplus tree-based data system and the <i>eqdsk</i> storage files produced directly by the EFIT reconstruction), necessitating parallel workflows for functionally identical tasks depending on the data source.</p>
