<p>The basic computational tasks associated with magnetic-equilibrium reconstructions in tokamaks, namely</p>

* the handling of derived quantities, *e.g.,* calculated plasma current, safety factor profile
* flux mapping between real-space machine geometry and different plasma coordinate systems for experimental data

<p>are universal among tokamak fusion experiments.  Despite this, experiments typically utilize locally-developed solutions designed for the particulars of that experiment's data storage and usage.</p>
