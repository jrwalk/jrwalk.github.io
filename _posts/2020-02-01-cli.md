tl;dr [read more on the Pluralsight tech blog](https://www.pluralsight.com/tech-blog/python-cli-utilities-with-poetry-and-typer/)

Unfortunately Python doesn't have a great story for building standalone executables (although tools like PyInstaller have come a long way) - there isn't a standardized way to package code, dependencies, and (potentially) runtime information in the same way as, for example, a fat `.jar` file for Java or a Go executable.
However, it is very doable to create alternate _entry points_ for your code - ways to access code in a Python package directly from the command line.
The package is still dependent on a Python environment for its dependencies, but otherwise can be treated like a properly versioned, `pip`-installable command line utility.
This pattern is _exceptionally_ common for Python utilities, including core management tools like `pip` and `virtualenv` (yes, you can `pip install pip` which is mind-bending) or code-quality tools like `black`, `flake8`, and `mypy`.

I recently published a post on Pluralsight's tech blog for building these tools, available [here](https://www.pluralsight.com/tech-blog/python-cli-utilities-with-poetry-and-typer/).
In it, we use some exciting new tools in the Python world:

- building a package with `poetry`: this gets us a number of benefits, like integrated tooling across environment and build control, and fully-specified, deterministic dependency resolution
- writing a command-line script: we’ll use the new `typer` library for its clean design and clever use of Python type annotations
- integrating the CLI: baking the script into the package’s entrypoints to make an installable utility

Example code for the post can be found [here](https://github.com/pluralsight/tech-blog-roll-the-dice).
Enjoy!
