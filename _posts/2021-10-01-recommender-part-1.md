On the Discovery team at Pluralsight, we're responsible for all aspects of our users' content exploration journey.
Some use cases are satisfied by our [core search functionality](https://medium.com/data-science-and-machine-learning-at-pluralsight/an-overview-of-search-at-pluralsight-2fc82173600f), but others require suggesting topics or content to users that don't necessarily know what they're looking for.

## The Data

We'll be using the MovieLens 25M dataset, a collation of twenty-five million movie ratings on a five-star scale collated by the GroupLens team at University of Minnesota, plus genre tags for every reviewed movie.
