## Hello.

I am a senior data scientist currently working at 
[Cinch Financial](https://cinchfinancial.com/), building a one-of-a-kind personal 
financial advisor to level the playing field with banks and credit card issuers. 
As the first hire on the DS team (joined April 2016), I have had a hand in every 
aspect of Cinch's development as a data-driven company, including designing 
end-to-end pipelines for machine-learning solutions from raw data 
ingestion/processing through modeling to production implementation, designing 
analytics dashboards & data visualizations, and even creating custom training 
materials for data analytics tools (Python, SQL, etc.) for junior business/data 
analysts.  I'm always looking for new ways to expand my toolkit & experience for 
ML & deep learning, statistical/Bayesian modeling, data visualization, and 
scalable data pipelines.

In my previous life, I was a researcher in 
[nuclear fusion energy](/pages/fusionprimer) at the MIT Plasma Science & Fusion 
Center's [Alcator C-Mod tokamak experiment](http://www.psfc.mit.edu/research/magnetic-fusion-energy), 
where I worked in various capacities since my Sophomore year, completing my 
doctorate in September 2014.  Following academic postdoctoral research at MIT,
I made the conversion to data science through the 
[Insight Data Science](http://insightdatascience.com/) program, an intensive 
postdoctoral fellowship geared towards STEM PhDs transitioning to data-driven 
industry, with the Boston session I attended particularly geared towards 
healthcare & biomedical applications -- I was particularly drawn to the 
opportunity for data science in socially-beneficial applications.

Outside of work, I spend my time hiking, rock & ice climbing, and 
mountaineering.  While most of my experience is in the excellent White Mountains 
of New Hampshire, I've also logged ascents of Mt. Rainier (14,411') in Washington, 
and Ixtacc√≠huatl (17,159') and Pico de Orizaba (18,491') in Mexico.
