## Hello.

#### who am I?

I'm a data scientist & ML engineer.

#### what do I love?

Building scalable data solutions, solving natural-language processing problems, and teaching Python and software engineering best practices to other data scientists.

#### what's my story?

I'm currently a machine learning engineer in the Boston office for [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/), focusing on data-driven and personalized approaches for our learners to explore and unlock new tech skills on the Pluralsight platform.
Previously, I was a manager / technical lead at Wayfair on the Merchandising Ops Data Science team, providing data-driven solutions for managing, maintaining, and capitalizing on structured & unstructured information about millions of Wayfair.com products.

Prior to Wayfair, my first Data Science role was as a data scientist at Cinch Financial, a smallstartup building a one-of-a-kind personal financial advisor to level the playing field with banks and credit card issuers.
I joined Cinch through the [Insight Data Science](http://insightdatascience.com/) program, an intensive postdoctoral fellowship geared towards STEM PhDs transitioning to data-driven industry.
The Boston session I attended was geared towards healthcare & biomedical applications -- I was particularly drawn to the opportunity for data science in socially-beneficial applications.

My academic background is in nuclear engineering, and before transitioning to data science I was a researcher in [nuclear fusion energy](/pages/fusionprimer) at the MIT Plasma Science & Fusion Center's [Alcator C-Mod tokamak experiment](http://www.psfc.mit.edu/research/magnetic-fusion-energy), where I had worked in various capacities since my Sophomore year, completing my doctorate in September 2014.

Outside of work, I spend much my time hiking, rock & ice climbing, and mountaineering.
While most of my experience is in the excellent White Mountains of New Hampshire, I've also logged ascents of Mt. Rainier (14,411') in Washington, and Ixtacc√≠huatl (17,159') and Pico de Orizaba (18,491') in Mexico.
I also enjoy board and tabletop games, and have worked for several years as an Enforcer at PAX East and Unplugged teaching new & unreleased board games.
