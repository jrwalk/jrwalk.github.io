## Hello.

#### who am I?

I'm a data scientist & ML engineer.

#### what do I love?

I build scalable data solutions, love natural-language processing problems,
and teach Python and software engineering best practices to other data
scientists.

#### what's my story?

I'm currently a Manager / Technical Lead at Wayfair on the
Merchandising Ops Data Science team, providing data-driven solutions for
managing, maintaining, and capitalizing on structured & unstructured
information about millions of Wayfair.com products.

Prior to Wayfair, I was a senior data scientist at Cinch Financial, a small
startup building a one-of-a-kind personal financial advisor to level the
playing field with banks and credit card issuers.  I joined Cinch through the
[Insight Data Science](http://insightdatascience.com/)
program, an intensive postdoctoral fellowship geared towards STEM PhDs
transitioning to data-driven industry.  The Boston session I attended
was geared towards healthcare & biomedical applications -- I was particularly
drawn to the opportunity for data science in socially-beneficial applications.

My academic background is in nuclear engineering, and before transitioning to
data science I was a researcher in [nuclear fusion energy](/pages/fusionprimer)
at the MIT Plasma Science & Fusion Center's
[Alcator C-Mod tokamak experiment](http://www.psfc.mit.edu/research/magnetic-fusion-energy),
where I had worked in various capacities since my Sophomore year, completing my
doctorate in September 2014.

Outside of work, I spend my time hiking, rock & ice climbing, and
mountaineering.  While most of my experience is in the excellent White Mountains
of New Hampshire, I've also logged ascents of Mt. Rainier (14,411') in Washington,
and Ixtacc√≠huatl (17,159') and Pico de Orizaba (18,491') in Mexico.
