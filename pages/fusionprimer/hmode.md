<p>As we saw previously, the formation of <a href="/pages/fusionprimer/pedestal">the pedestal</a> in H-mode dramatically improves fusion performance - the pedestal supports much higher core pressure (and therefore greater fusion power density), while the suppression of turbulence in the edge improves energy confinement by a factor of two or more, along with increased particle confinement.</p>

<p>This presents problems, however: the plasma retains impurities (metal wall material, helium "fusion ash") as well as fuel ions, leading to radiative losses that eventually overcome the heating power, dropping the plasma back into L-mode.  <strong>This H-mode is an inherently transient state.</strong></p>

<p>So what we need is high <i>energy</i> confinement specifically, with low <i>particle</i> confinement (low enough, at least, to avoid impurity buildup).
And that's it, right?</p>

<p>Under the right conditions, the plasma develops <strong>Edge-Localized Modes</strong> (ELMs) - periodic instabilities that relax the pedestal, driving a burst of energy and particles out of the plasma.
This is sufficient to prevent impurity accumulation.</p>

<p>On current experiments, this is the baseline for high performance, and was thought to be acceptable for fusion reactor use.  However, on a reactor-scale device, these ELMs drive enormous pulsed heat loads - effectively like detonating a hand grenade in the exhaust several times per second, far in excess of material tolerances for the reactor wall.</p>

<p>So what we need, then, is high energy confinement, low particle confinement, and to avoid (or mitigate or suppress) large ELMs.
Fortunately, a number of solutions exist: engineering fixes (external controls that suppress or smooth out the ELM cycle), and physics solutions in the form of steady H-modes without ELMs, where the pedestal is regulated by some benign fluctuation below the ELM limit.  A number of these regimes exist, but each has its pros and cons - high-performance operation without ELMs, then, is a major research focus.</p>
