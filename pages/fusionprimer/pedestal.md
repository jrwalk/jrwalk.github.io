<p>To reach sufficient fusion power gain, a tokamak needs to reach a minimum value of thermal pressure and energy confinement time - the former sets the fusion power density, and the latter measures how well the plasma retains its heat (thus how well heat from fusion can maintain the necessary conditions for a self-sustaining reaction).
The maximum pressure (relative to magnetic field strength) is set by stability limits: we need to make up the difference with confinement improvements.</p>

<p>By default, both energy and particles are driven rapidly from the plasma core by turbulence - and this transport gets worse with more heating power!
The brute force approach is to run in a larger machine with stronger magnetic fields to compensate, but this is expensive.  <strong>In its default state, this plasma is not suitable for an economical power plant.</strong></p>

<p>Under the right conditions (shaping, heating power) the plasma transitions to "high-confinement" or H-mode (compared to the default "low-confinement" L-mode).
The plasma forms a transport barrier, the <strong>pedestal</strong>, in the edge, where sheared flows cut off turbulent transport - density and temperature profiles "pile up" behind this barrier, leading to much higher core pressure and fusion power density.</p>
